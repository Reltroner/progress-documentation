# Reltroner — Progress Documentation Repository

This repository contains the **official progress documentation** for projects developed under the **Reltroner** identity.

It serves as a **living record of engineering decisions, architectural milestones, audits, and frozen phases** across multiple systems — including **Reltroner ERP**, **Reltroner Studio**, and future long-term projects.

This is not a marketing repository.  
This is a **record of work done, decisions made, and contracts enforced**.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Document **real engineering progress**, not ideas or roadmaps
- Preserve **architectural truth** at specific points in time
- Record **phase freezes**, invariants, and non-negotiable contracts
- Provide **verifiable references** for engineers, reviewers, and collaborators
- Serve as a long-term **knowledge ledger** for Reltroner systems

Every document here exists because **something was built, tested, and stabilized**.

---

## What You Will Find Here

This repository may contain documentation for:

- ✅ Reltroner ERP (Finance, HRM, SSO, internal platforms)
- ✅ Reltroner Studio systems & infrastructure
- ✅ Authentication gateways & system boundaries
- ✅ Accounting and data-integrity architectures
- ✅ Phase Freeze declarations
- ✅ Audit reports and compliance confirmations
- ✅ Root Cause Analyses (RCA) for resolved issues
- ✅ Architectural records (as-built, not theoretical)

Each document reflects a **completed or stabilized state**, not work in progress.

---

## What You Will NOT Find Here

This repository intentionally does **not** contain:

- ❌ Tutorials or learning guides
- ❌ Framework comparisons or hype
- ❌ Feature wishlists or speculative designs
- ❌ Unverified concepts
- ❌ Temporary experiments

If something is documented here, it means:

> **It existed, it was tested, and it was trusted enough to be recorded.**

## Documentation Philosophy

Reltroner documentation follows these principles:

- **Clarity over completeness**
- **Contracts over convenience**
- **Tests over intention**
- **Boundaries over shortcuts**
- **Stability over velocity**

Documentation represents **architecture as-built**, not architecture-as-planned.

---

## Phase-Based Structure

Many documents follow a **phase model**, where each phase:

- Has a clearly defined scope
- Locks specific architectural responsibilities
- Declares explicit non-responsibilities
- Is frozen once correctness is proven

After a phase is frozen:
- Silent changes are forbidden
- Evolution happens only in subsequent phases
- Revisions require explicit declaration

This ensures **long-term system integrity**.

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:

- Engineers who value correctness and system boundaries
- Technical leads and architects reviewing real implementations
- Founders evaluating engineering maturity
- Collaborators joining at later phases
- Future maintainers (including future-me)

This repository is **not optimized for beginners**.

---

## Status of Documents

Each document will clearly state its status, such as:

- `IN PROGRESS`
- `FROZEN`
- `AUDITED`
- `FINAL`

A frozen document represents a **non-negotiable architectural truth** at that point in time.

## About Reltroner

Reltroner is a long-term system-building effort focused on:

- Internal platforms
- ERP-class software
- Authentication and access control
- Data integrity and correctness
- Sustainable architecture over time

All projects are built with an emphasis on **clarity, responsibility, and survivability**.

---

## Final Note

This repository exists to answer one question:

> **“What was actually built, and what was proven to be correct?”**

If you are looking for fast demos, this is not the place.  
If you are looking for **engineering that can be trusted**, you are in the right repository.
