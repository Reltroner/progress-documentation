# 📌 Finance Reltroner — Architectural Overview

**Finance Reltroner** is not a CRUD accounting application.

It is a:

> Contract-Locked · Deterministic · Audit-Grade  
> Financial Infrastructure Engine

The system is built around:

* Contract-based accounting  
* Immutability enforcement  
* Deterministic financial computation  
* Audit-first governance  
* Strict architectural layering  

It is designed for:

> Historical integrity.  
> Financial correctness.  
> Computational determinism.  

This is an enterprise-grade accounting kernel.

# 🧱 Frozen Architecture Baseline (STEP 5.1 – 5.6)

Phase 5 is officially frozen through STEP 5.6.

| Step | Layer                          | Status    |
|------|--------------------------------|-----------|
| 5.1  | Domain Data Contract           | 🔒 FROZEN |
| 5.2  | Write Governance               | 🔒 FROZEN |
| 5.3  | Read Architecture              | 🔒 FROZEN |
| 5.4  | Snapshot & Analytics           | 🔒 FROZEN |
| 5.5  | Budget vs Actual Engine        | 🔒 FROZEN |
| 5.6  | Advanced Analytics Core        | 🔒 FROZEN |

All public contracts within this range are locked.

Any modification requires:

* Freeze Revoke Protocol  
* Contract Migration  
* Full Regression Re-certification

# 🧠 Architectural Principles

---

## 1️⃣ Contract-Based Accounting (STEP 5.1)

The database is the source of truth.

Examples:

* `normal_balance` is mandatory and explicit  
* No implicit inference  
* No hidden fallback  
* No runtime tradition-based logic  

Accounting behavior follows data contracts, not conventions.

---

## 2️⃣ Write Immutability (STEP 5.2)

Once a transaction is:

* Posted  
* Or fiscal period locked  

It cannot be edited or deleted.

Corrections occur via reversal entries only.

Single write path:

```

UI / API / Seeder
↓
TransactionService
↓
Observer
↓
Database

````

No bypass allowed.

---

## 3️⃣ Read Is Pure (STEP 5.3)

The read layer:

* Does not mutate  
* Does not “fix” data  
* Does not infer missing state  
* Does not correct domain errors  

Trial Balance, P&L, and Balance Sheet are deterministic projections.

---

## 4️⃣ Snapshot = Immutable Financial Memory (STEP 5.4)

The snapshot layer is:

* Append-only  
* Hash-verified  
* Ledger-drift protected  
* Deterministically serialized  

Snapshots are never updated.

Analytics layer is implemented as pure compute:

* KPI Engine  
* Projection Engine  
* Forecast Engine  
* Scenario Engine  
* Risk Engine  
* Hybrid Engine  
* Chaining Orchestration  

All are deterministic and stateless.

---

## 5️⃣ Financial Comparison Kernel (STEP 5.5)

Budget vs Actual engine:

```php
compare(int $fiscalPeriodId, int $version): array
generate(int $fiscalPeriodId, int $version): BudgetVsActualReportDTO
````

Guarantees:

* Deterministic
* 4-decimal rounding
* Division-by-zero guard
* Missing metric guard
* Missing period guard
* Explicit sorting
* No mutation
* No DB access in compute layer

This is the financial comparison kernel.

---

## 6️⃣ Advanced Analytics Core (STEP 5.6)

Includes:

* Forecast (CAGR, Fixed Growth, Moving Average, Linear)
* Scenario (Additive, Multiplicative, Stress, Cap/Floor)
* Risk Envelope (Volatility, Compression, Shock)
* Hybrid (Forecast vs Budget)
* Scenario Chaining (Forecast → Risk → Hybrid → Risk)

All services are:

* Stateless
* Deterministic
* Immutable DTO flow
* Isolation-tested
* Manually instantiable (no container dependency)
* Version-ready

Analytics namespace contains **zero DB access**.

---

# 🔐 Determinism Standard

Finance Reltroner enforces:

> Identical input → Identical output

Enforced via:

* Explicit sorting
* Strict typing
* 4-decimal precision
* No `random()`
* No `time()`
* No hidden state
* Snapshot hashing
* Deterministic chaining

Probabilistic drift is not tolerated.

# 🏗 Layer Separation

| Layer           | Responsibility           | Mutation    |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| Database        | Truth storage            | Controlled  |
| Service (Write) | Journal governance       | Controlled  |
| Service (Read)  | Projection               | None        |
| Snapshot        | Aggregation memory       | Append-only |
| Analytics       | Pure financial math      | None        |
| Hybrid          | Financial comparison     | None        |
| Chaining        | Orchestration only       | None        |
| Reporting       | Export / Projection only | None        |
| Controller      | HTTP boundary            | None        |

There is no cross-layer leakage.

---

# 🧪 Testing Baseline

Current certification:

* 99 tests
* 274 assertions
* 0 failures
* Freeze validated

Run:

```bash
php artisan test
```

Tests are governance.

If tests fail:

> Freeze integrity is compromised.

# 🧭 Strategic Roadmap

| Phase | Description                                 | Status  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 5.1   | Domain Contract Foundation                  | 🔒      |
| 5.2   | Write Governance                            | 🔒      |
| 5.3   | Read Architecture                           | 🔒      |
| 5.4   | Snapshot & Analytics                        | 🔒      |
| 5.5   | Budget vs Actual Kernel                     | 🔒      |
| 5.6   | Advanced Deterministic Analytics            | 🔒      |
| 5.7   | External Reporting Gateway (Versioned JSON) | Planned |
| 6.x   | Multi-Entity & Consolidation                | Planned |

Future phases must layer above frozen contracts.

# 🔑 Governance Philosophy

Finance Reltroner is built on one principle:

> Accounting history must never lie.

Extended principle:

> Financial comparison must never drift.

Determinism is mandatory.
Immutability is mandatory.
Contracts are binding.
